Explanation :
The provided code performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie plots using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with TextBlob. It follows a structured approach in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure clear documentation and reproducibility.
First, it loads necessary libraries, including pandas for data handling, TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and matplotlib.pyplot for visualization. The dataset is then loaded from a CSV file and basic information is displayed to understand its structure. To ensure data quality, missing values in the "plot" column are removed.
A sentiment analysis function is defined using TextBlob, which calculates the polarity of each movie plot. If the polarity score is positive, the sentiment is classified as "Positive"; if negative, it is "Negative"; and if neutral, it is "Neutral." The function is then applied to all movie plots in the dataset.
To analyze the results, a bar chart visualizes the distribution of sentiment categories, providing insights into how movies' plots are generally perceived. Finally, key insights are summarized, explaining the potential implications of sentiment distribution in movie storytelling. This structured workflow ensures efficient data preprocessing, model implementation, and interpretation of results.
